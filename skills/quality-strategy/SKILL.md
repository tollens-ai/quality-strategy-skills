# Quality Strategy

This skill runs a structured interview to produce `quality/strategy.md` — a business-level document defining what success looks like for the project and how to get there. It is grounded in Edmund Pringle's quality framework.

The skill is intentionally long — a serious strategy takes a working day or two of hard thinking spread across multiple sessions (see README for full context). The work is broken into 21 small sub-steps so progress is easy to see, the user can pause at any point, and the strategy doc builds up section by section — what's already written survives interruptions. Taking longer than expected is a sign that real thinking is happening; rushing produces a strategy that looks complete but skipped the substance.

## Resolving file paths — do this first

This skill is part of the `quality-strategy` plugin. Resolve three paths and use them throughout — `$PLUGIN_ROOT` immediately; the other two are settled by the session-start questions, not guessed beforehand:

- **PLUGIN_ROOT** — the plugin's install directory: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (Claude Code expands this to an absolute path when it loads this file; read it off and note it down). Every file this skill references — `PHILOSOPHY.md`, the sub-step files under `skills/quality-strategy/steps/`, etc. — lives under it, as does `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, whose `version` field stamps the generated strategy (see sub-step 1.1 and "Output").
- **REPO_SCOPE** — the absolute path(s) of the repo(s) or directories being *analysed*: one or several. Products often span several repos — never assume one; session start asks which are in scope (see "Session start"), and the working directory is only the natural suggestion for a one-repo product. In the sub-step files, `$PROJECT_DIR` means *the repo a brief targets*: with one repo in scope it is simply that repo throughout; in a multi-repo scope, per-repo dispatches each get their own repo's absolute path substituted for it (the fan-out rules live in the sub-steps). The scope is analysis input only — the strategy stays one document for the system, not one per repo.
- **DOCS_DIR** — the absolute path the strategy's outputs are *written* under: the whole `quality/` family (`quality/strategy.md`, `quality/pre-read.md`, `quality/releases/`, `quality/ideas.md`, `quality/.scratch/`, `quality/archive/`) plus `.skill-feedback.md`, together as one unit — never split across locations. This is the save location the user chooses at session start (see "Session start" below): one of the repos in scope when the strategy goes in-repo, or a directory outside them for a local first pass. Resolve it on **every** invocation, before the session-start moves write anything: if the working directory holds a `quality/` folder, the working directory is the docs home — read `quality/.scratch/session-config.md` and restate the standing choices; if it holds none, ask whether this is a fresh strategy here or one saved elsewhere (see "Resumption") — only a confirmed fresh start proceeds to the session-start ask. Normalisation: the directory the user names *becomes* `$DOCS_DIR` and the `quality/` folder is created inside it; if a path they point at already ends in `/quality`, its parent is `$DOCS_DIR`. Every `quality/...` path in this skill and its sub-step files resolves under `$DOCS_DIR` — including inside subagent briefs, where you substitute the resolved absolute path, since a sealed subagent can't ask anyone where the docs live.

File references below use the `$PLUGIN_ROOT` and `$DOCS_DIR` placeholders, plus the per-repo `$PROJECT_DIR` in sub-step briefs. **Substitute the resolved absolute paths before you act on them** — both when you Read a file yourself (including the sub-step files) and when you put a path into a subagent brief. The Read tool does no variable expansion and resolves relative paths against the current working directory, not this skill's directory; a dispatched subagent inherits none of your context. So an unsubstituted placeholder or a bare relative path will fail — always pass fully-resolved absolute paths.

## Before you start

Read `$PLUGIN_ROOT/PHILOSOPHY.md` if you haven't already. The disciplines that recur in every step — interview don't infer; ask rather than guess; record assumptions; understand the why; make confidence visible; push back on vagueness (ask for precision — when, how often, to what extent — never invent it); make non-goals explicit; stay sequential — are non-negotiable and applied throughout.

## Phrasing — adapt, don't recite

You are running a working session as a sharp facilitator would — a useful management consultant, not a robot reading a script. The sub-step files quote example prompts (the *italicised* lines) to show the **intent** of each question and the bar it has to clear. They are illustrations, not lines to read verbatim. Put them in your own words, fitted to *this* user, *this* project, and what they just told you: compress or expand, match your tone to a precise expert versus a stuck novice, drop the preamble once rapport is established, follow up harder where an answer came back thin.

What is fixed is the *substance* — the question that must get answered, the check that must pass, the push-back that must happen, the assumption that must be recorded. What is free is the *wording*. So: never skip a substantive question, soften a real check, or drop a required push-back to sound friendlier — but equally, never recite a prompt word-for-word when a more natural phrasing does the same job better. When a sub-step says *"ask X"*, it means *get X answered*, not *utter this exact sentence*. A session that sounds like a person thinking with the user beats one that sounds like a form being read aloud — and the framework's rigour lives in the substance, which adapting the words does not touch.

Keep the language **plain** (PHILOSOPHY: *say it plainly*) — in what you say *and* in what you write to the doc. Framework terms get a one-clause gloss on first use; everything else is everyday English: short words, active verbs, concrete examples. You sound like a sharp consultant talking, not a standards document.

## Heavy only where it serves the user's goals

This process is demanding, and the demand can feel heavy to a user who just wants to ship. The weight is a feature only when the user can see it serving **their own stated goals** — the stakeholder Dealbreakers and Delight bars, the release purpose, the things *they* said matter. Three standing rules keep it that way:

- **Frame every why in the user's own words.** Every substantive ask or stretch of work gets its why framed in terms of what *this* user already said — *"we're digging here because you said losing a user's data is a dealbreaker"* — never in terms of the framework's own needs. Early on, before the stakeholder bars exist, the trace is the release purpose and whatever goals the user has stated so far; once Part 3 exists, trace to the named bars.
- **The standing pruning rule.** An item — a question, a dimension, a check, an action — that traces to no stated goal is spurious weight. Either cut it, or challenge whether a goal is missing: *"nothing you've told me makes this matter — should it? Is there a stakeholder or a bar we haven't captured?"* Never carry untraceable weight silently.
- **The honest fork when a goal-justified item meets resistance.** When the user pushes back on something the trace genuinely supports, show the trace, then offer the fork: *"this is here because you said X is a dealbreaker — so either this deserves the dig, or X isn't really a dealbreaker. Which is it?"* Be convinced the item matters for the goal, or revise the goal. **Both outcomes are legitimate**, and both get recorded — conviction lands in the section's rationale; revision lands as a change to the bar it traced to.

This sharpens the substantive refusals rather than softening them: the things the skill refuses to skip (non-goals, the unpack pass and the old/new-world *reasoning*, real checkpoints) are exactly what make the user's stated goals checkable — when a user balks at one of those, that is the trace to show. (The old/new-world reasoning is non-skippable; what it is *not* is a ceremony the user sits through — it runs as machinery and surfaces only its outcomes. See sub-step 5.3.)

## Session start — the itinerary, the repo scope, where the strategy lives, and the commit cadence

Five moves at the start of every working session (first or resumed), before the next sub-step's work begins — and, on a first session, before sub-step 0 writes anything to disk:

**Give the itinerary, in plain words.** Walk the route by human name — what each step produces *for the user*, with rough relative sizes — not the sub-step table read aloud. For example: *"Seven steps, and the first two are quick: context (what the project is, who's working on it) and releases (what's shipping when). Then stakeholders — the first real thinking: who matters and what their bars are. Non-goals — short but load-bearing: what we're deliberately not doing. Dimensions — the longest step: the axes quality breaks into here. The risk map — the headline: where you're actually exposed. And the plan of work — short, and optional. We're at [X]."* On resumption the itinerary doubles as re-orientation: what's done, what remains.

**Ask which repo(s) we're analysing (first session).** Products often span several repos — an app repo, an API repo, an infra repo — and a strategy that silently analyses whichever one you happen to be sitting in describes a fraction of the system. So ask, before the save-location question (whose options depend on the answer): *"Is everything we're analysing in this repo, or does the product span others? List everything that's in scope — paths I can reach, or names and I'll ask where they live."* Set `$REPO_SCOPE` to the answer; one repo is a fine answer, and with no repo at all the scope is empty and the interview carries the load. Beyond about five repos, warn that per-repo evidence gathering gets deep and slow at that width, and offer to scope this pass to the load-bearing repos — recording the rest as out of scope for this pass, not silently dropped. However many repos are in scope, the output is still **one strategy for the system**: repos are where evidence comes from (and evidence can cite which repo it came from), never a reason to split the document.

**Settle where the strategy will live — and say why: you want their true opinions (first session).** The interview ahead asks for candid judgment: who really matters, what's actually weak, what the user would cut. Everything they tell you persists — each sub-step writes their answers into the `quality/` docs — and where those docs live decides who can read them. A user who doesn't know where their words are going either holds back exactly the candor the strategy needs, or gives it and regrets it. So before anything is written to disk, tell them two things in the same breath — that you want them to be able to answer really honestly, and where their answers will be recorded and who will see them — and ask where that should be:

> *"Before we start: this works best when you can answer really honestly — your true opinions about what matters, what's actually weak, what you'd cut. Everything you tell me gets written into the strategy docs, so where they live decides who reads your answers. Two usual homes. **In the repo** (`<project>/quality/`) — right when the strategy should be everyone's the moment it exists; anyone with repo access will read what you say here, and commits publish it to them. Or a **local first pass** — a folder outside the repo, say `~/strategies/<project-name>/` — right when this is one person's take that you want to iterate on privately and share only if and when it's ready. Or name any directory you like."*

When in-repo would put the answers in front of a wide audience — many committers, an open or org-visible repo, or the user hesitates at "anyone with repo access"; the first two are a glance at the git log's author list and the remote host, or simply ask *"roughly how many people can read this repo?"* — don't just offer the local pass neutrally: **recommend it**. Do the private copy first, tidy it up or redact later, and share when it's ready. The choice stays the user's; the recommendation is part of an honest ask, not pressure.

With several repos in scope, "in the repo" sharpens to *"in which repo?"* — suggest the umbrella or primary repo if one exists; when none stands out, a folder outside all of them is usually cleaner. Set `$DOCS_DIR` to the answer (normalised as in "Resolving file paths": the named directory is the home; the `quality/` folder goes inside it). The whole output family follows it as one unit — strategy, pre-read, release bank, ideas ledger, scratch state, archive, feedback notes — never half the docs in one place and half in another. If the user asks for in-repo-but-gitignored, honour it but name the hazard in one line: a private draft inside a shared working tree is one accidental `git add` from published, so a folder outside the repo is the safer private option. And when there is no repo at all (see "Running without a repo is first-class"), the ask collapses to confirming which folder should hold the docs — it still runs; what never happens is silently defaulting a candid draft into a location the user didn't choose.

Promoting a local pass later needs no machinery — when it's ready to be everyone's, tidy or redact anything that was for-your-eyes-only candor (the user's own editorial pass on their draft — no skill does it for them), copy the `quality/` folder into the repo, refresh `session-config.md` inside it to record the new in-repo location (or delete the note and let the next session re-ask), and commit; `.skill-feedback.md` deliberately stays behind — it's notes about the skill, not part of the strategy. Say so if the user asks. And when you make the private-copy recommendation, mention the other route to something shareable: **`/strategy-variants`** (run once the strategy is finished and reviewed) derives audience-facing files — a distributable one-pager, or a client-safe version that drops the frank internal candor without lying — without ever editing the honest doc, so the private pass can stay private and still produce something to hand out.

And candidness is raised here, **once — never sprung mid-session**. Folding the honesty rationale into this ask is what licenses the pointed questions later (who really matters, what's actually weak, what would you cut): by the time they arrive, the user already knows where their words go, because they chose it. Don't re-open the subject mid-interview with a fresh *"this next part is sensitive"* warning — a user surprised by candidness halfway through has been failed by this ask, not helped by the warning. If the user turns visibly guarded mid-session (answers going suddenly short, hedged, or diplomatic), restate the standing choice in one line — *"this still only goes to `<location>` — nobody else reads it unless you move it"* — rather than running a new disclosure ceremony.

**Ask the commit-cadence question (when the save location is git-managed).** Where `$DOCS_DIR` is git-managed — unless the docs are gitignored there, in which case commits can't include them: skip the question and record "gitignored — no cadence" in the session-config note — ask once: *"As the strategy doc builds up, want me to commit at each step boundary, commit everything at the end, or leave the commits to you?"* Suggest commit-as-we-go as the default — rollback stays cheap, and each boundary commit doubles as visible progress. One qualifier: where the docs sit in a repo other people share, say what the cadence means in the same breath — each boundary commit publishes that step's draft to everyone who pulls. The user chose in-repo knowing who reads it; this line keeps the consequence visible at the moment it becomes mechanical, and a user who hesitates at it may prefer commit-at-the-end or a local pass after all. Honour the answer at every step boundary from then on; don't drift.

**Record the choices in the session-config note.** Write the session-start decisions — the repo scope (every absolute path with its scratch slug — the directory basename, lowercased — plus anything deliberately scoped out this pass), the save location (with its one-line who-can-see-this reasoning), and the commit cadence (or why there is none: "not git-managed", "gitignored") — to `$DOCS_DIR/quality/.scratch/session-config.md`, so they survive `/clear`: a resumed session reads the note and restates the standing choices in one line instead of re-asking, and re-asks only what the note is missing. (Strategies begun under older versions may carry only `quality/.scratch/commit-cadence.md`; read the cadence from it and carry it forward into `session-config.md`.)

The standing rule behind all of this (and behind the progress lines and visible exits at every boundary — see "Substantive checkpoint at step boundaries"): **the user must never feel the process is unbounded.** At any moment they should know where they are, what remains and roughly how big it is, and what they keep if they stop here.

## The four-question frame and the strategy's job

A quality strategy answers four questions, in order:

1. **What does good look like?** — stakeholder bars, dimensions, required levels (Steps 1–6.1).
2. **How do we know if what we have is good?** — the oracles (ways of judging) and instruments (tools that measure) we'd use to judge the actual state. This is its own question, not a free rider on Q3.
3. **Is what we have good?** — the actual-state assessment, each actual naming the basis that judges it (Steps 6.2–6.3).
4. **How do we make it good?** — the plan of work to close gaps (Step 7 — a sketch, and optional; see "The plan of work is a sketch" below).

**Q2 is explicit on purpose — and deliberately not executed here.** The common failure is to collapse Q2 into Q3 — to claim an actual level from whatever signal happens to exist, without ever asking whether that signal can judge the dimension. This skill's share of Q2 is **honesty**: sub-step 6.2 requires every actual to name its basis (what was observed, and what judges it) or be recorded as Unknown. The Q2 *sweep* — auditing each dimension's oracle and planning better judging — is the follow-on **`/evaluation-strategy`** lane, run after the strategy closes; the quality strategy stays pure (who matters, what they value, where we stand) rather than attempting an oracle sweep it isn't equipped to carry.

**The strategy's job.** Before the analysis, Step 1 (sub-step 1.1) asks what this strategy is *for, right now*, and records it as a `## Strategy job` paragraph at the top of the doc. The four jobs:

- **Durable production strategy** — active product/release; ongoing quality management; full machinery applies.
- **Pre-implementation strategy** — actuals are mostly unknown; the job is to focus the build and name what evidence the first implementation must produce.
- **Agentic one-shot experiment** — the primary question is whether the docs can steer an agent to a correct, usable artifact with minimal human steering.
- **Lightweight slice / prototype** — many production dimensions should be explicitly **None**, not treated as gaps.

The same framework and the same rigour apply to all four; what differs is the right *output* and the right *severity of review*. `/quality-strategy-review` reads this paragraph first (its contextual-fit gate) and adapts what counts as a blocker accordingly. Project *shape* (solo / team / org; shipped / not-yet / dormant; agent-driven or not) is a separate axis that shapes how questions are *phrased*, not how deep the analysis goes — full project-shape branching is a later phase, but capture shape in Step 1 where it helps phrasing.

**Running without a repo is first-class.** Two of the four jobs — pre-implementation and agentic one-shot — are *normally* run with little or no code to hand, and even a durable-production strategy can be built by a founder or lead who has the project in their head but no repo open. This is a supported, sensible way to use the skill, not a degraded fallback: a quality strategy is most valuable *before* the build, when it can still steer it. When there's no codebase to scan, the pre-read degrades honestly (it says so, and tags what it inferred vs scanned — see sub-step 0), the interview carries the load it always carries, and the closing review judges the strategy against its no-repo job rather than docking it for unknown actuals. Don't apologise for the missing repo or treat it as a problem to work around — interview the user as the authority on their own project, record assumptions, and produce the strategy. The only thing a missing repo costs is the pre-read's scan-derived hypotheses; everything load-bearing was always going to be asked, not read. (The session-start ask about where the strategy lives still runs — with no repo it just collapses to confirming which folder holds the docs.)

## Sealed-context dispatch and scratch files

Wherever this skill does substantive analytical work via a subagent — the pre-read (sub-step 0), the dimension scout (5.1), the dimension rating (5.4), the targeted design deep-dive (6.2, when thin-evidence design-shaped dimensions exist), the boundary contradiction check (`/contradiction-check`), the distillation (`/operational-distillation` at 7.3), and — in revision mode — the two look-forward passes (the fresh defect recon and the what's-new context scan; see Revision mode) — the dispatch is **sealed-context**: the subagent sees only what it needs for its piece, not the parent's DONE criteria, not the rubric it will be judged against, not the destination doc's success conditions. The orchestrator's role is **dispatch / collect / reconcile / present**, not to do the analysis itself with the answer key in view. This is the central anti-shortcut principle of the pack.

**Every such dispatch writes a scratch file** at `$DOCS_DIR/quality/.scratch/<sub-step>-<purpose>.md` recording the real intermediate work it did (e.g. `0-pre-read-*.md`, `5.1-dimension-scout.md`, `5.4-dimension-rating.md`, `6.2-design-deep-dive.md` (conditional — an explicit skip note in the doc stands in when no dimension qualified), `<boundary>-contradiction-check.md`, `7.3-operational-distillation.md`; revision mode adds `revision-defect-recon.md`, `revision-context-scan.md`, and — for its closing whole-doc contradiction check — `revision-contradiction-check.md`). This converts "did the orchestrator actually do the work?" from invisible to auditable: `/quality-strategy-review` mechanically checks that every claimed dispatch has its scratch file. A missing scratch file is hard evidence the dispatch didn't happen. `quality/.scratch/` is working state, not part of the strategy — do not treat it as authoritative output, and don't leak its contents into `quality/strategy.md`.

**Process-note leak prevention.** Orchestrator meta-observations about *the skill itself* (an awkward step, a suspected bug, phrasing that didn't land) go to `$DOCS_DIR/.skill-feedback.md` only — never into `quality/strategy.md`. The strategy doc reads as an authored artifact, not a transcript of the skill running.

The *machinery* of running the skill — dispatch/scratch narration ("Subagent dispatched: …", "[ran 5.4 inline]", "scratch would be `quality/.scratch/…`"), append bookkeeping, sub-step/turn lineage refs ("corrected, turn-23", "split out at 5.2") — likewise has no place in `quality/strategy.md`. **This is cleaned up at review time, not by loading the writing pass with a list of don'ts.** Write the finding or the question; the step-boundary review and the final `/quality-strategy-review` strip any machinery that slipped through (see "Presentation cleanup at review points" below). The reasoning: a pass that's busy doing the real analysis shouldn't also juggle a list of don'ts — that taxes the work and still misses leaks. Catching them where the doc is reviewed is both lighter on the writer and more thorough.

## Deliver revelations as moments

The highest-value thing this skill can produce is not the document — it's the moment the user realises something matters about their project that they never articulated (PHILOSOPHY: *the revelation is the product*). The sealed passes are where these surface: the dimension scout (5.1), the pre-read, the fresh-eyes recon in revision mode. Each reads the project without the user's framing, so each can find something the user never mentioned but their stated goals imply they'd care about.

When that happens, **do not bury it in a consolidated list.** Name it back as a moment, traced to their own goals: *"you didn't mention X anywhere — but given what you said about Y, you'd care a lot if X failed. Does that land?"* Then record the outcome either way: if it lands, it enters the doc as the user's own, with the trace; if it doesn't, record that it was considered and why the user set it aside. **A rejected revelation is data, not failure** — it usually sharpens a non-goal.

This is a delivery discipline, not a new pass. The work already happens; the discipline is to spend the find where it pays — as a named moment the user gets to react to, not row 17 of a table.

## Scope of this skill — one release deep, every release captured

The strategy is explicitly **per-release**. The doc header names the release it covers (set at sub-step 2.1), and the depth analysis (stakeholders, three-lens, non-goals, dimensions, risk map, plan of work) is that release's analysis — **one release at a time**, typically the next one the team is about to ship. Other releases are noted at purpose level during sub-step 2.1 (Roadmap) so the strategy isn't blind to what's coming. This is deliberate: a release's context shapes the strategy heavily, and deep analysis of a release whose context isn't settled yet produces speculation, not strategy.

**But capture faithfully across releases — the release bank.** Users often dictate more than one release's worth of strategy in one session (*"for the beta, losing a game record is the dealbreaker — oh, and when we do the enterprise release, compliance becomes the whole game"*). Never flatten that into the current release's sections, and never drop it. The standing rule, live at **every** sub-step: content that belongs to a different release is **banked** — recorded faithfully, close to the user's own words, labelled with its release — in `quality/releases/<release-slug>.md` (slug: the release name, lowercased and hyphenated — for a release the user hasn't named yet, ask for a working name, or slug their own phrase for it; create the file on first use, append after). Tell the user in half a line — *"banked for the enterprise release"* — and carry on with this release's work; don't detour into deep analysis of a release that isn't this one, and don't make the user repeat themselves when its turn comes. The bank is durable content, not scratch: new-release mode pre-loads it as starting hypotheses. Dictate once, keep it, use it when its release arrives.

When the team is ready to start a future release, re-invoke the skill in new-release mode (see Revision mode below) to produce a fresh strategy for it — banked notes in hand. Some sections (team, workflows, roadmap) carry over with incremental updates; others (stakeholders, dimensions, risk map, plan of work) are largely rewritten because the release context has changed.

## Spontaneous user ideas — capture once, classify later

Users generate ideas as they work through the strategy — *"we could diff the two implementations nightly"*, *"every change should get a review pass"*, *"I'd know it broke if the ramp-up doc stopped matching reality"*. **Don't prompt for these** — there's a time for that later: eliciting measurement, rule, and testing ideas is the follow-on lanes' job, and prompting mid-strategy derails the interview into solution space. But when the user **spontaneously** offers one — something that goes *beyond answering the question just asked*: a volunteered suggestion for how something could later be tested, measured, or enforced — it has a dedicated home — the **ideas ledger**, `quality/ideas.md` (create on first use, append after). A plain descriptive answer is not an idea: *"we ship every two weeks"* is Part 1 content, a dealbreaker threshold is a Part 3 bar; the ledger holds only the volunteered how-we'd-check-or-uphold suggestions that have no Part of their own.

- **The user's words**, close to verbatim, linked to the dimension or context it arose in (and the release). One bullet per idea, so a later lane can annotate a single entry: `- "<the user's words>" — <dimension/context>, <release>, <date>`. Acknowledge in half a line — *"noted in the ideas ledger"* — and carry on; no detour into designing it. The ledger is one file across all releases — deliberately, unlike the per-release bank: an idea volunteered during one release's session is usually still worth considering when a later release's lanes run, and the per-entry release tag carries the provenance.
- **No classification at capture time.** Don't decide whether it's a proxy, an oracle, a process rule, a test charter, or something else — the same idea is often several at once (a review-per-change habit is simultaneously a quality proxy and a process rule), and role assignment is the lanes' job, done later with the whole strategy in view. A capture that pre-files the idea under one role quietly closes the others off. Capture is also deliberately exempt from the pruning rule and the precision push-back — those govern what enters `quality/strategy.md`; the ledger is raw and unchallenged by design, judged later by the lane that considers adopting it.
- **An idea for a different release still goes to the ledger** — its release tag carries the provenance. The release bank holds non-idea strategy content — bars, priorities, purpose — dictated ahead of its release; a volunteered how-we'd-check-or-uphold suggestion goes to the ledger whichever release it's for.
- **The lanes read the ledger as an input.** Each follow-on lane, at ingest, walks the ledger and considers each idea for its own modality; an idea can land in several lanes. A lane that adopts one annotates the entry (*"→ taken up in test-strategy, <date>"*) — never deletes it, since a sibling lane may want it too.

The ledger is durable content, not scratch — like the release bank, it survives sessions and gets consumed by later skills.

## The plan of work is a sketch — follow-on skills elaborate it

Part 7 (Step 7) lists, classifies, and sequences the work at *strategy* level — enough to see the shape of what's needed, the priorities, and the first moves. It is deliberately **not** a detailed work plan, and you should not let it become one. The detail belongs to the follow-on skills, each of which takes a slice of Part 7 and turns it into a first-class plan of its own:

- **Testing work** → `/test-strategy` — the testing lane: where investigation would move the risk map (`quality/test-strategy.md`).
- **Evaluation work** → `/evaluation-strategy` — the evaluation lane: where better quality instruments — oracles that judge, proxies that indicate — would make the project knowable (`quality/evaluation-strategy.md`); agreed build items go on to `/tooling-strategy` for the prioritised build plan (`quality/tooling-strategy.md`).
- **Rules and process work** → `/process-strategy` — the rules/invariants/processes lane: where changing how work is done prevents whole defect classes (`quality/process-strategy.md`).
- **Communicating the strategy** → `/strategy-variants` — audience-facing variants of the finished doc.

The three lanes are **deliberately lighter** than this skill — high-level ideas and questions per ility, one or two focused conversations each, the differential stated in their own prompts. Each ingests this strategy for the release, filters for the ilities its modality can make a dent on, and works have-already / could-improve / could-add through them with the user.

Stakeholder work and fixing work have no follow-on skill yet; they stay at sketch level in Part 7 like everything else. Keep Part 7 entries to one or two lines each, resist expanding any of them into a mini-plan in place, and point at the relevant follow-on instead — a Part 7 that duplicates `test-strategy.md`'s depth goes stale the moment the follow-on runs.

**Step 7 is optional — the whole sketch can be deferred.** At the Step 6 boundary, once the user has confirmed at the 6.3 substantive checkpoint, offer the choice: walk Step 7 now, or skip it and defer the plan of work wholesale to the follow-on lanes. Skipping is the right call when the team will run the lanes (`/test-strategy`, `/evaluation-strategy`, `/process-strategy`) immediately — a sketch written minutes before its own elaboration adds nothing. The skip is **recorded, never silent**: append a short Part 7 deferral note —

```markdown
## Part 7: Plan of Work

Deliberately deferred — elaborated by the follow-on lanes rather than sketched here:
testing work → `/test-strategy` (`quality/test-strategy.md`); evaluation work →
`/evaluation-strategy` (`quality/evaluation-strategy.md`, builds via `/tooling-strategy`);
rules/process work → `/process-strategy` (`quality/process-strategy.md`). <If a slice of

First investigation: the risk map's hottest items (Part 6).
```

If any "aware, not investing this release" decisions surfaced during the risk-map discussion (the conscious deferrals sub-step 7.1 would normally record), capture them in the deferral note — that record must not be lost to the skip. Then run the same closing moves sub-step 7.3 prescribes, unchanged: the boundary `/contradiction-check` over the whole doc, `/operational-distillation`, `/quality-strategy-review`, and the `/effective-comms` pass (see "Final step: distill, then review"). The review treats a recorded deferral as satisfying its plan-of-work checks; a Part 7 that is simply missing or empty, with no deferral note, remains a failure.

## How this skill is structured

The work is divided into 7 numbered steps, each with one or more sub-steps — 21 sub-steps in total, including the pre-read (sub-step 0) that runs before Step 1. Each sub-step lives in its own file under `steps/`. The full sequence:

| Sub-step | File | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Pre-read | `steps/0-pre-read/0-dispatch.md` | Project digest at `quality/pre-read.md` |
| 1.1 Purpose | `steps/1-context/1-1-purpose.md` | Product purpose, immediate goal, longer-term ambition |
| 1.2 Team | `steps/1-context/1-2-team.md` | Roles including agent team members |
| 1.3 Workflows | `steps/1-context/1-3-workflows.md` | How work actually flows |
| 1.4 Release workflow | `steps/1-context/1-4-release-workflow.md` | How releases ship |
| 1.5 Budget | `steps/1-context/1-5-budget.md` | Resources and constraints |
| 2.1 Roadmap | `steps/2-releases/2-1-roadmap.md` | Per-release purposes |
| 3.1 Identify stakeholders | `steps/3-stakeholders/3-1-identify.md` | Who matters per release |
| 3.2 Three-lens analysis | `steps/3-stakeholders/3-2-three-lens.md` | Delight / Good Enough / Dealbreaker per stakeholder |
| 4.1 Non-goals | `steps/4-non-goals/4-1-non-goals.md` | Explicit exclusions per release |
| 5.1 Dimension inventory (raw) | `steps/5-dimensions/5-1-inventory.md` | Bottom-up + top-down (subagent) + reconcile → raw consolidated inventory |
| 5.2 Unpack pass | `steps/5-dimensions/5-2-unpack.md` | Split composite dimensions into sub-dimensions where priorities differ |
| 5.3 Old/new-world pass | `steps/5-dimensions/5-3-old-new-world.md` | Split trap dimensions where the audience (human vs agent) changes the rating |
| 5.4 Rate dimensions | `steps/5-dimensions/5-4-rate.md` | Mechanical-anchor impact rating (H/M/None) per dimension — per-stakeholder via a sealed dispatch, then merged; no L (L-style aware-but-not-investing is a Step 7 decision) |
| 5.5 Sanity checks | `steps/5-dimensions/5-5-checks.md` | High justification, stakeholder coverage, tensions, non-goal alignment |
| 6.1 Required levels | `steps/6-risk-map/6-1-required.md` | What level is needed for each H/M dimension |
| 6.2 Actual levels | `steps/6-risk-map/6-2-actual.md` | Where we are on each H/M dimension |
| 6.3 Gap and confidence | `steps/6-risk-map/6-3-gap-and-confidence.md` | The risk map combining required + actual + confidence on both sides |
| 7.1 Derive actions | `steps/7-plan-of-work/7-1-derive.md` | What needs doing, drawn from the risk map |
| 7.2 Classify | `steps/7-plan-of-work/7-2-classify.md` | Each action as testing / stakeholder / fixing |
| 7.3 Sequence | `steps/7-plan-of-work/7-3-sequence.md` | Phasing and dependencies |
| 7.3 — Operational distillation | invoke `/operational-distillation` (separate skill) | TL;DR + triage rubric placed at the top of the strategy |
| 7.3 — Effective Comms pass | invoke `/effective-comms` (separate skill) | Audience-fit / hidden-context / names-before-coordinates gate before the doc is finalized |

Sub-steps 7.1–7.3 are **optional** — the user may defer the plan of work wholesale to the follow-on skills via a recorded deferral note (see "The plan of work is a sketch"); the 7.3 closing moves (contradiction check, distillation, review, Effective Comms pass) run either way.

## Execution rules — non-negotiable

1. **Execute the sub-steps strictly in order.** Later sub-steps depend on earlier ones.

2. **Read one sub-step file at a time.** Do not read sub-step *N+1* until you have completed sub-step *N*. Reading multiple sub-step files at once leads to racing through the work and producing a strategy that looks complete but skipped the substance.

3. **For each sub-step:**
   - Read its file.
   - Execute the pre-read, interview, and section-writing as the file directs.
   - Run the **"This sub-step is DONE when"** checklist at the end of the file.
   - If any check fails, return to questioning. Do not proceed.
   - When all checks pass:
     - **At intermediate sub-steps** (1.1–1.4, 3.1, 5.1–5.4, 6.1–6.2, 7.1–7.2), do a light wrap-up: summarise in 2–4 lines and ask *"any quick concerns, or ready to continue?"* Move on at yes.
     - **At step boundaries** (end of sub-steps 1.5, 2.1, 3.2, 4.1, 5.5, 6.3, 7.3), run the **substantive checkpoint** (see below) on the whole step's output. Only proceed after explicit, considered confirmation.
   - Only then read the next sub-step file.

4. **Write output incrementally.** As each sub-step completes, append the relevant section to `quality/strategy.md`. If a session is interrupted, what's already written is durable.

## Substantive checkpoint at step boundaries

This is the single most important user-facing pattern in the skill. The strategy is waterfall — mistakes caught early cost minutes; mistakes caught late cost hours of rework. So each step boundary needs a real gate where the user genuinely engages.

**Where it runs.** At the end of each of the 7 steps — the close of sub-steps **1.5, 2.1, 3.2, 4.1, 5.5, 6.3, 7.3** — not at every sub-step. Per-sub-step transitions get a light wrap-up. The substantive checkpoint runs at step boundaries because that's when:

- The user has a complete chunk of strategy to evaluate (a whole Part of the doc, not a fragment).
- The user can read back the whole step and ask *"does this hang together?"* rather than evaluating a single piece in isolation. Smells about priorities or completeness usually only become visible when you can see the whole step at once — you can't tell if a stakeholder's three lenses are right by looking at one stakeholder; you tell by looking at all of them together.
- Cross-step revisions become practical. Doing later steps often surfaces things that change earlier steps' answers (e.g. while doing dimensions in Step 5, you realise a stakeholder's bar from Step 3 was wrong). The step-boundary checkpoint is when that gets acted on.

### The pattern at each step boundary

0. **Run the contradiction check first (sealed dispatch).** Before summarising, dispatch **`/contradiction-check`** as a sealed-context subagent on the doc *as written so far* — substituting the resolved absolute `$DOCS_DIR` paths (the doc, and the `quality/.scratch/` destination for its scratch file) into the brief, since a sealed subagent can't ask where the docs live. It mechanically cross-references the Parts for internal contradictions — a Part-3 dealbreaker a Part-4 non-goal excludes, an H/M dimension with no risk-map row, a high-confidence actual whose evidence is "none yet". This is a *different* failure mode from the substantive checkpoint below: the checkpoint catches "this feels wrong to me" (human, by feel); the contradiction check catches "Part X denies what Part Y asserts" (mechanical, by cross-reference). Fold any contradictions it returns into the summary so the user sees them at the checkpoint. The dispatch writes its scratch file (see "Sealed-context dispatch and scratch files"). A clean result is a real result — say so and move on.

0b. **Silently strip presentation leakage from this step's Part(s).** Re-read the section(s) this step just appended to `quality/strategy.md` and quietly remove machinery that isn't strategy — see "Presentation cleanup at review points" below for the patterns. Do this without narrating it; the cleanup never appears in what you say to the user. This is review-time cleanup of the freshly-written Part, the per-subsection counterpart to the final whole-doc review.

1. Summarise the *whole step's* output back to the user in 5–8 lines, covering the decisions that matter across all sub-steps in the step — plus any contradictions the check surfaced. Not a recap of process — a recap of decisions.

1b. **Give the progress line and the visible exit.** One line of where-we-are, with relative sizes: *"That was Step 5 — the longest one. Two steps left: the risk map, about half the size of what you just did, and a short optional plan of work."* And one line of what stopping here leaves them with: *"If you stopped now, you'd walk away with your stakeholders' bars and the rated dimensions on paper — already something you can act on — and we can resume from the doc any time."* Both are honest, not cheerleading: the doc genuinely is useful part-done, and resume genuinely is supported.

   **Ground any time-empathy in the actual session.** A line acknowledging elapsed effort — *"we've been at this a good while"*, *"after all this work"* — is only honest when it's *true of this run*. A half-hour lightweight session is not "a good while", and a weariness line that doesn't match the clock reads as canned and quietly undermines the trust the progress lines are building. So check the real session — elapsed time, the weight of what was covered, how many steps in — before you reach for one, and skip it entirely when the run has been short or light. Like the example prompts, these are intent, not a script to recite on a timer.

2. Run the substantive checkpoint:

   > *"Take a real moment to read this back. We've completed [Step name]. Is anything off — even if you can't articulate why? Anything that gives you a weird feeling? Anything in earlier steps that, in light of this work, you now think is wrong? Even vague unease is worth surfacing. Catching it now is cheap; catching it later costs hours of rework."*

   **Adapt the tone to the user.** When the user has been giving precise, articulate, complete answers — an expert who knows their domain — the open "any vague unease even if you can't name it?" prompt reads as a tic. Prefer the *targeted* form as the default: name the one place you most expect to be wrong and why, and ask them to test it — e.g. *"Here's the one place I'd bet this is most likely wrong, and why: <…> — does that hold?"* Reserve the open-unease phrasing above for users who are visibly uncertain or inarticulate. This is a change of phrasing only — the checkpoint itself still runs at every step boundary and still does the same work.

3. **Wait for the user's response.** Treat any of the following as signals to dig in, *not* as confirmation:
   - "I think so."
   - "Looks fine I guess."
   - Silence.
   - "Yeah, sure."
   - Any hesitation or non-committal response.

   Honest follow-up: *"What's making it 'I guess' rather than 'yes'? Even a vague feeling is worth investigating — that's a smell, and smells are signal."*

4. **If the user surfaces something**, treat it as a finding:
   - **Articulable concern about this step** — address it now. Re-do the relevant sub-step.
   - **Articulable concern about an earlier step** — surface explicitly: *"That's about [earlier step]. Want to revisit that section before continuing? Or note as `OPEN QUESTION` and keep going?"* Cross-step revision is first-class, not a failure.
   - **Vague unease, can't articulate** — investigate together. Probing questions: *"What part of the section draws your eye?" "If you imagine this strategy in six months, where would the regret most likely come from?" "What's the closest you can get to naming it?"* Either it resolves and the section is corrected, or it remains as `OPEN QUESTION:` with the user's explicit acknowledgement that we're proceeding with that risk visible.

5. **Only move on after explicit, considered confirmation** — not silence, not a non-committal response, not a polite "yes" with hesitation behind it. Once confirmed, this is where the boundary commit lands if the user chose commit-as-we-go at session start — the commit snapshots the *confirmed* step, never a version still under discussion.

### Per-sub-step (intermediate) wrap-up

At the end of intermediate sub-steps (1.1–1.4, 3.1, 5.1–5.4, 6.1–6.2, 7.1–7.2), do a **light wrap-up only**: summarise back in 2–4 lines, ask *"Any quick concerns, or ready to continue?"* — get a yes, move on. Save the deep engagement for the step boundary. The user can't really evaluate intermediate sub-steps in isolation anyway — full evaluation needs the whole step in view.

While you're here, give the sub-section you just appended a quick, silent presentation-leakage scan (see below) — it's cheaper to strip a stray "scratch would be…" line now than to find a Part full of them at the step boundary. Keep this light and unannounced; the thorough pass is the step-boundary one.

## Presentation cleanup at review points

The strategy doc should read as an authored artifact — the *findings and decisions*, not a transcript of the skill's machinery producing them. Rather than load the writing pass with a list of don'ts (which taxes the real work and still misses leaks), the cleanup happens **at review time**, on text already written, where it's both lighter and more reliable. Three review points share the job:

- **Intermediate sub-step wrap-ups** — a light scan of the one sub-section just written.
- **Step boundaries** — a thorough scan of the whole Part this step produced (item 0b in the pattern above), before you summarise it back.
- **The final `/quality-strategy-review`** — its check 21 is the whole-doc backstop for anything the per-Part passes missed. It is a *strip*, not just a flag: machinery check 21 surfaces is removed from the doc before the strategy is declared done, not merely noted. This matters most in **revision / resumption mode**: the per-Part boundary scans only see Parts written *this* session, so a strategy carried over from a prior version can contain leak patterns (provenance columns, sealed-pass narration) the boundary scans never touched — the final review must scan the **entire** doc, inherited content included.

**Do all of this silently — narrating the cleanup is itself a leak.** The scan is internal hygiene: never announce you ran a presentation pass, never tell the user the doc is "clean of machinery / no turn refs / no inferred-as-scanned", never report the result of the scan. The user hears *findings and questions*; the cleanup is invisible. (The worst version of this is narrating *"presentation-cleanup pass… clean"* at every step boundary — ironically leaking the machinery while claiming to remove it.) The same "findings, not plumbing" discipline applies to your **own user-facing turns**: talk to the user about the strategy, not about dispatches, scratch files, sealed passes, or which sub-step produced what. This is one light principle — *speak findings, not machinery, and do the cleanup without mentioning it* — not a content-prohibition list.

At each scan, re-read the target text and strip these machinery patterns — keep the finding, drop the narration:

- **Dispatch / scratch / sealed-pass narration** — "Subagent dispatched: …", "[ran 5.4 dimension-rating inline]", "scratch would be `quality/.scratch/…`", **and the sealed-context merge vocabulary**: "sealed pass landed M", "surfaced to the user", "merged to H because…", "the sealed dispatch returned…". Keep the *decision* (the rating, the merge outcome and its reason); drop the *mechanism* that produced it. E.g. rewrite "Bundle footprint — sealed pass landed None, surfaced to the user, merged to H" as "Bundle footprint — rated H: no stakeholder bar referenced it directly, but a stakeholder added a promotability bar that makes it a dealbreaker."
- **Append / orchestration bookkeeping** — "I'll hold off appending Part 4 until the user confirms", "now writing this to the doc". Do it silently.
- **Sub-step / turn lineage references** — both *turn* refs ("corrected, turn-23", "the turn-22 binding test") and *sub-step-number* refs ("split out at 5.2", "Action 6 from 7.1", "folded in from 7.1", "(pulled out of non-goals at turn 16)"). The reader of the final doc has no "turn 23" and no "7.1"; the strategy carries no provenance or lineage — it reads as settled content. (Cross-references to the doc's own *Parts* — "see Part 6" — are fine; references to the *process* that built it are not.)
- **Provenance / source-column vocabulary** — in the dimension inventory's source/evidence column and in rating rationales, the *name of the internal pass that surfaced or rated a dimension*: "Subagent pass", "reference-list pass", "subagent C's design observations", "Subagent dispatched: `dimension-scout`", "the per-stakeholder pass returned None … merged to H", "the oracle-adequacy pass as direct inputs". Keep the real grounding the column exists to carry — the stakeholder bar, the pre-read observation, the named file — and drop the dispatch/pass name that produced it. A "source" cell should cite *what the dimension rests on*, not *which internal pass emitted it*. (This pattern hides in table cells and rationale prose, so it survives a prose-only scan — look for it explicitly.)
- **Scratch-file path citations** — a "Sources consulted: `quality/.scratch/5.1-dimension-scout.md`" or "rests on … + `quality/.scratch/5.4-dimension-rating.md`". `quality/.scratch/` is working state the reader does not have; cite the real underlying source (the pre-read digest, the stakeholder bars, the named code files) instead, or drop the citation. A `.scratch/` path must never appear as a source in the strategy doc.
- **Inferred-as-scanned pre-read lines** — a "no audited gem detected" / "no `.github/workflows` found" written as if a scan ran when no code was actually read. Rephrase to the honest form the pre-read uses ("not yet established — confirm in interview") or cite the interview honestly. (This is the review-side companion to sub-step 0's honest-degradation rule.)

Two exemptions. The `## Since the last revision` section a revision writes (see Revision mode) is content, not machinery — its what-happened verdicts and newly-found items compare the *project* against its prior strategy, which is analysis the reader wants. Leave it. And a **pointer to the release bank or the ideas ledger** (*"further detail for the enterprise release: `quality/releases/enterprise.md`"*; *"ideas volunteered along the way: `quality/ideas.md`"*) is content too — both are durable, reader-visible files, unlike `.scratch/` — leave the pointer; what gets stripped is capture *narration* elsewhere in the doc ("banked for X", "noted in the ideas ledger", "wrote to the bank") — keep the pointer, drop the play-by-play.

This is *presentation* cleanup only. It changes nothing about what work runs or which scratch files get written — every sealed dispatch still executes and still writes its scratch file, which `/quality-strategy-review`'s scratch-file audit reads on disk. What changes is only what lands in the doc and what you say to the user.

**Names before coordinates (PHILOSOPHY: *write for both readers*).** The doc's own cross-references, and everything you say to the user, follow the pack's dual-legibility rule: labels and numbers ("Action F", "dimension 14", "Part 6") are pointers for cross-referencing, not names. At first mention in any section — and in any user-facing turn — call the thing by its human name with the label trailing as a pointer: *"the payment-divergence simulation (Action F)"*, not a bare *"Action F"*. Each section of the strategy should stand on its own for a reader who didn't write it and doesn't have the rest of the doc in working memory.

## Initial pre-read

Before reading sub-step 1.1, run sub-step 0 (`steps/0-pre-read/0-dispatch.md`). Sub-step 0 is the first thing in the whole process that writes to disk, so the session-start moves — above all, where the strategy lives — must be settled before it runs. It dispatches subagents that read the repo(s) in scope — one dispatch set per repo when the scope has several — and produces a structured digest at `quality/pre-read.md`. Later sub-steps use the digest as starting hypotheses so the main agent does not have to load the whole project into its own context window.

## Pause and resume

The work is hard thinking — the user will need breaks, not just want them. Be **opinionated** about where to take them: some sub-steps belong tightly together and breaking between them costs working memory; others are natural seams. If a user is trying to push through past 90 minutes of intense thinking, tell them the work degrades when they're tired and recommend a break — better to resume fresh tomorrow than ship a sloppy step today.

### Stick-together sets — keep going, do not suggest `/clear`

These sub-step sequences depend heavily on the user's live working memory from the previous sub-step. The strategy doc captures the artefact, but not the live discussion (which stakeholder felt thin, which trade-off was surfaced, which dimension nearly got dropped). Breaking in the middle forces the next sub-step to re-orient from cold doc — losing real signal.

- **3.1 → 3.2** — stakeholder identification flows into three-lens. The discussion about who matters and why is the working memory for the lens analysis.
- **5.1 → 5.2 → 5.3** — the inventory evolves through unpack and old/new-world. The user's mental model of the dimensions accumulates across all three.
- **6.1 → 6.2 → 6.3** — required, actual, gap. Each H/M dimension should stay fresh across all three; jumping between dimensions while context is cold loses precision.

When the user is partway through a stick-together set, do not suggest `/clear`. If they ask to take a break, tell them: *"This sub-step is part of a tight sequence with the next — we'd lose some working memory if we broke here. Want to push through to [end of set], or take a longer break before starting fresh?"* Let them choose; just be explicit about the cost.

### Natural break points — recommend `/clear` here

After any of these, the conversation is at a natural seam and `/clear` loses nothing important (the strategy doc + pre-read digest are the source of truth):

- After sub-step 0 (pre-read)
- After Step 1 (after 1.5)
- After Step 2 (after 2.1)
- After Step 3 (after 3.2)
- After Step 4 (after 4.1)
- After 5.3 (inventory complete)
- After 5.5 (Step 5 complete)
- After Step 6 (after 6.3)
- After Step 7 (before review)

At each of these natural break points, **proactively suggest `/clear`** rather than waiting for the user to notice the conversation is long — and **say how to resume in the same breath**, so resuming is stated, never guessed: *"That's a natural break point. The strategy doc captures everything we've agreed; if you'd like to take a break or do this in another session, this is a good place to `/clear`. To pick up, just run `/quality-strategy` again — it reads your `quality/` docs and scratch state and resumes from where we left off; you won't lose your place."* Don't make the user notice and ask, and don't leave them to gamble that re-running the skill works — tell them it does. If the strategy lives outside the repo (a local first pass), add the one extra thing resuming needs: *"we saved the strategy at `<DOCS_DIR>` — if you resume from a folder that doesn't hold it, just point me at that path."*

### Step 5 specifically

Step 5 is the longest single step (five sub-steps, with 5.1–5.3 stick-together). Before starting 5.1, check in: *"Step 5 (Quality Dimensions) is the longest step — five sub-steps, three of which (5.1–5.3) work best done in one session. If you're tight on time, this is a good place to take a break first."*

### Resumption

On re-invocation, first re-find the docs home (this is the same on-every-invocation rule as in "Resolving file paths"), then detect the state of `quality/strategy.md`:

- If the working directory has a `quality/` folder, the working directory is the docs home: set `$DOCS_DIR` to the working directory, read `quality/.scratch/session-config.md`, and restate the standing choices (repo scope, save location, commit cadence) in one line instead of re-asking.
- If it doesn't, **don't assume a fresh start** — the strategy may be a local pass saved elsewhere. Ask: *"Starting a fresh strategy here, or resuming one saved somewhere else? If elsewhere, point me at the folder."* One pointer restores everything: the session-config note saved beside the strategy carries the rest of the choices. (If the pointed-at path ends in `/quality`, its parent is the docs home.) Only when the user confirms fresh does the session-start sequence run from the top.

If a partial strategy exists:

- Read the existing doc to determine the last completed sub-step.
- Tell the user, naming the step in human words, not bare coordinates: *"I see a partial strategy. Last completed: the dimension ratings (sub-step 5.4). Want to pick up from the sanity checks that follow, or revisit something earlier first?"* — and give the session-start itinerary (see "Session start — the itinerary, the repo scope, where the strategy lives, and the commit cadence") so they see what's done, what remains, and the relative sizes.
- If the user is resuming into the middle of a stick-together set (e.g. they completed 5.1 in the prior session and are now resuming at 5.2), name it: *"Note that 5.2 is part of a stick-together set with 5.1 and 5.3 — re-orient from the inventory in `quality/strategy.md` before we start to recover the working memory."*
- Resume from the user's chosen sub-step.

### Within a sub-step

"Let me come back to that" is allowed. Record the deferred item as `OPEN QUESTION: <one-line description>` in the relevant section of the strategy doc. The sub-step's DONE checklist tolerates flagged-as-deferred items, as long as they are explicitly recorded. The final review skill will surface all open questions across the strategy.

## Revision mode

**The mode map — establish which mode you're in before touching anything.** The same skill serves five modes, and each forbids different things. An agent landing mid-task (after `/clear`, a handoff, or a compaction) reads the doc and scratch state to establish the mode — in this order: a `## Since the last revision` recording a correction scope means a **correction** in progress, bound by its recorded union; otherwise a fresh archive snapshot in `quality/archive/` (dated this revision) means an interrupted **re-walk or new-release** run — the session-config note or the archive's own name says which; only a part-done doc with *no* fresh archive and no `## Since the last revision` is a plain **resumption** (`## Since the last revision` is written late, so its absence alone proves nothing when an archive exists) — and then follows that mode's protocol, not a blend:

- **Fresh** — no strategy exists (or path (a) below): run the sub-steps from the top. Forbidden: silently carrying anything over.
- **Resumption** — a partial strategy: continue from the last completed sub-step (see "Resumption"). Forbidden: re-opening confirmed sections without the user asking.
- **Correction** — path (b): the doc misstates something; entry triage first, then scoped template re-application over the touched sections' downstream tree (see "Correction path (b)"). Forbidden: re-opening sections outside the recorded union; propagating any downstream change without user ratification.
- **Full re-walk** — path (c): walk all sub-steps, existing content as starting hypothesis. Forbidden: treating inherited content as confirmed without the look-back/look-forward movements.
- **New release** — path (d): archive, then a fresh strategy for the new release, bank pre-loaded. Forbidden: silently inheriting the old release's analysis as still current.

If `quality/strategy.md` already exists at full length (i.e. all sub-steps were completed in a prior session), one check before anything else: if the doc's `## Since the last revision` records a correction scope whose union members still lack outcomes, that correction is **in progress** — resume its union walk under the recorded scope (no second archive, no re-ask). Otherwise ask the user before doing anything else:

> I see a complete strategy. Are we:
> (a) starting fresh and replacing it;
> (b) **correcting or revisiting specific sections** — I'll first check with you whether it's a genuine correction or the world has moved;
> (c) doing a full re-walk of the current strategy, using the existing content as starting hypothesis;
> (d) **starting a new release** — in which case I'll archive the current strategy to `quality/archive/strategy-<release-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` and produce a fresh one for the new release?

**Archive first — whatever the answer.** Before changing a word, snapshot the current doc to `quality/archive/strategy-<last-updated-date>.md` — the date the doc was last updated, from its header if it carries one, else the file's modification date (path (d) uses its release-name form above). If that filename is already taken, suffix `-2`, `-3`, … — never overwrite an archive. Never silently rewrite history: the archive leaves a before/after trail the user can compare and share, and it is the instrument `/quality-strategy-review` diffs against when it reviews the revision. Mention the archive in your closing summary so the user knows it exists. One exception: re-entering the skill to fix blockers from a `/quality-strategy-review` of this same, not-yet-done strategy is the tail of the same writing session, not a revision — don't archive again, and don't re-run the movements below.

- For (a), proceed normally; the existing file will be overwritten as you go.
- For (b), run the **correction path** below: entry triage, then scoped template re-application over the downstream tree — plus the three movements, scoped to the union.
- For (c), walk all sub-steps as the three movements below, using the existing content as starting hypothesis for the look-back.
- For (d) — **new-release mode** — walk all sub-steps fresh. Sub-steps that change less between releases (1.1 Purpose, 1.2 Team, 1.3 Workflows, 1.4 Release workflow, 1.5 Budget, 2.1 Roadmap) should pre-load the archived prior version's section as starting hypothesis and ask "what's changed?". Sub-steps that change more (3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x) start more or less from scratch because the release context is fundamentally different — **except what the user already dictated**: check `quality/releases/` for this release's banked notes (see "Scope of this skill") and pre-load them as starting hypotheses at the sub-steps they belong to, named back for confirmation (*"when we banked this you said compliance becomes the whole game — still true?"*), never silently assumed still current. Don't make the user repeat what they already told a previous session. Once the bank is worked through, mark it consumed — prepend *"Consumed into the <release> strategy, <date>"* to the bank file so a later session pre-loads only what's new, and the user never re-adjudicates notes twice. And note the doc lifecycle: path (d) rebuilds the strategy fresh after the archive — sub-step 1.1 re-creates the header (new `Release:` placeholder) and 2.1 stamps the new release.

### Correction path (b) — triage first, then scoped template re-application

**Entry triage — correction, drift, or context change?** Users under-flag context changes — people are really bad at flagging every context change as a release — so diagnose rather than accept the user's framing. The discriminating question, asked of yourself and of the user: **"was the document wrong about what was true then, or has what's true changed since?"**

1. **Genuine correction** — the doc misdocumented what was true for this release; the world is unchanged. (*"Tom's dealbreaker was recorded too strictly — he always tolerated one-offs."*) Run the scoped re-application below.
2. **Small context drift** — something has genuinely changed since, but **the goals hold**: the stakeholder bars (Part 3) and non-goals (Part 4) still say what they'd say if re-asked today. (*"The release slipped three weeks — dates move, nobody's bar does."*) Correction-style handling is still safe: run the scoped re-application, eyes open, and record in `## Since the last revision` that this was drift handled as a correction, naming what drifted.
3. **Overall context changed** — what's true has changed **and the goals move with it**: re-asked today, some bar, priority, or non-goal would come out differently. (*"Our biggest customer churned — who matters and what's a dealbreaker just changed."*) However the user framed it, this is implicitly a new (or different) release: switch to **new-release mode** (path (d)) — the whole template, the previous doc referenced as starting hypotheses, but assume anything might have changed. Say why you're switching, in the user's terms: *"that's not the doc being wrong — the world moved; if we patch sections one by one we'll keep a strategy whose goals no longer fit it."*

The 2-vs-3 test is the goals, not the size of the change: would Parts 3 and 4 survive being re-asked? Yes → drift (2). No, or you can't honestly say → context change (3).

**The scoped re-application (verdicts 1 and 2).** Archive-first stands, as for every revision. Then:

1. **Locate**, for each correction, its first-touched template section — the earliest Part/sub-step whose recorded content is wrong.
2. **Compute the downstream tree** from `$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/quality-strategy/SECTION-DEPENDENCIES.md` — the explicit section-dependency graph. Consult the file; don't improvise the graph from memory. **Multiple corrections = the union of their trees**, walked once in template order. When the union is effectively the whole doc, say so and offer path (c) or (d) instead — a "correction" that rewrites everything isn't one.
3. **Record the plan before editing**: the triage verdict, the touched section(s), and the computed union go into `## Since the last revision`. This recorded union is the scope the review's diff check holds the revision to.
4. **Re-apply the template to exactly that union.** Walk the affected sub-steps' own files in template order, re-running their interview and writing moves for the union's sections only. You may **suggest** the obvious inferences — *"your fix to Tom's tolerance changes the correctness row's heat but nothing in the inventory; I suggest the inventory stands"* — but **every downstream conclusion is run past the user as if that part of the tree were being written fresh**; nothing propagates silently. "Run past the user" scales with what you find: where the corrected input genuinely changes a dependent section, that section's interview re-runs; where the honest answer is *no change*, the move is a one-line suggested keep-as-is the user confirms — never a re-run of the sub-step's full interview for its own sake. Record each union section's outcome: **changed** (with what), or **examined-unchanged** (suggested keep-as-is, user confirmed). The sub-steps' own DONE checklists still gate their sections, and where the union crosses a step boundary the substantive checkpoint and the boundary commit fire as usual — correction mode scopes the walk, it doesn't relax the gates.
5. **Untouched sections are never re-opened** — preservation by construction, not by promise. If working the union surfaces a problem *outside* it, that's a new correction: triage it and extend the union explicitly (re-recorded in `## Since the last revision`), never quietly wander.
6. **Close as a revision closes**: the three movements below run scoped to the union (the look-forward dispatches only where the correction re-asserts the risk map's actuals — the standing skip rule applies), and their per-item what-happened verdicts land in the **same** `## Since the last revision` section, beside the union-outcome ledger from steps 3–4 — a correction's section carries both, not one or the other; the closing `/contradiction-check` runs over the **whole** doc (cheap, and it's what catches seams at the union boundary — scratch: `quality/.scratch/revision-contradiction-check.md`); refresh the TL;DR via `/operational-distillation` when the union touched anything it summarises; refresh the header stamp.

### Revising = look back, then look forward, then reconcile

A revision that only checks the prior doc's known problems concludes "we fixed everything — all good now". But known problems are only the ones you knew about; the project has changed since the doc named them, so **the gaps have moved**, and a pass anchored on the old doc will not find where they went. **Fixing all known problems is not the same as being good now.** So a revision (paths b and c) runs as three movements:

1. **Look back (deliberately anchored).** For each H/M risk-map row, open question, and planned action in the prior version: what actually happened? A "fixed" claim needs evidence — the commit, the test, the measurement — or it is recorded as *believed fixed* at an honest confidence, not closed. Re-rate the actuals from what you find, not from what was planned.

2. **Look forward (deliberately blind).** Fresh-eyes passes run **without the prior doc in their context**, via the sealed-dispatch machinery above: a fresh defect recon over the current source — covering every repo in the recorded scope (the session-config note carries the list), not just the one you're sitting in — the same independent blind-pass pattern as `/test-strategy`'s standing fresh-eyes defect recon, and a fresh scan of what's new since last time — new features, new stakeholders, changed context. The standing question for both: *the gaps have moved — where to?* The blindness is load-bearing: analysis anchored on an existing doc reliably plans *around* the defects that independent blind passes find. Each dispatch writes its scratch file: `quality/.scratch/revision-defect-recon.md` and `quality/.scratch/revision-context-scan.md`.

3. **Reconcile.** Merge the forward findings into the back-verified structure. Where the fresh analysis contradicts inherited content, surface the contradiction to the user explicitly — never silently inherit the old claim. Inherited content escaping this-session checks is a known weakness of re-walks (the same class as the inherited-content cleanup below); reconciliation is where it gets caught.

**Record the movements in the doc.** The movements' results land in a short `## Since the last revision` section near the top of the doc (below `## Strategy job`): the revision date and scope (full re-walk, or the sections a path-(b) revision touched); a what-happened verdict for each prior H/M row, open question, and planned action in scope — "fixed" with its evidence, *believed fixed* at a confidence, still open, or overtaken; and what the look-forward newly found (or the recorded skip note below). This section is content, not machinery — comparing the project against its prior strategy is analysis the reader wants, so the presentation scans leave it alone. It is also how `/quality-strategy-review` knows the doc is a revision and what scope to hold the look-back to.

**Refresh the header stamp.** A revision is generated by *this* version of the skill, so update the header's `Last updated` date **and** re-resolve the version stamp from `$PLUGIN_ROOT/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (the prior version's stamp is preserved in the archived snapshot). The live doc always names the version that last touched it, so a bug report traces to the right code.

Scope the movements to fit: for (b), the look-back covers the prior items the union's sections carry. The look-forward dispatches run whenever the revision re-asserts the risk map's actuals — skip them when the edit makes no claim about the project's current state (a wording fix, a stakeholder rename), or when the revision is a targeted re-assessment of named risk-map rows after a tooling build lands (the build's own evidence is the new input there, not a fresh recon). Record any skip in the `## Since the last revision` section, so the review knows it was deliberate.

**Inherited-content cleanup (paths b, c, and resumption).** When you carry content over from an existing strategy rather than rewriting it from scratch, that content was never seen by *this* session's step-boundary presentation scans — so any machinery it already contains (provenance/source-column vocabulary, sealed-pass narration, turn or sub-step lineage, `.scratch/` citations) will survive untouched. Before the final review, run a **whole-doc** presentation-cleanup scan (see "Presentation cleanup at review points") over the entire strategy, inherited Parts included, and let the final `/quality-strategy-review` check 21 strip whatever remains. Do not assume a doc you inherited is clean just because the Parts you wrote this session are.

## Final step: distill, then review

After sub-step 7.3 is complete and the content is confirmed — or, if the user chose to skip Step 7, once the deferral note is recorded and the boundary `/contradiction-check` has run over the whole doc — two closing moves (each invocation, like every dispatch, gets the resolved absolute `$DOCS_DIR` paths in its brief):

1. **Distill.** Invoke `/operational-distillation` on the produced doc. It reads the whole strategy and inserts an Operational TL;DR (6–10 lines) plus a one-page triage rubric at the top, so a returning reader re-orients in seconds. The distillation is a *view* of the body, not a second source of truth — if they disagree, the body wins. (Sub-step 7.3 prompts this.)

2. **Review.** Invoke `/quality-strategy-review` on the produced doc. The review skill is the source of truth for "is this strategy any good" — it first runs a **contextual-fit gate** (reading the `## Strategy job` paragraph and adapting severity to the strategy's job), then applies the seven indicators and runs mechanical oracle checks (missing non-goals; all-High dimension ratings; percentage confidences; missing three-lens entries; missing scratch files for claimed dispatches; etc.).

3. **Effective Comms pass.** Before the strategy is finalized for its reader, invoke `/effective-comms` on the produced doc. It checks audience fit, hidden scratch context, names-before-coordinates, retained rejected ideas, and leaked agent process-history — the ways a correct strategy can still fail to communicate. If a check fails, revise the doc before finalizing; if a residual risk genuinely cannot be resolved, it is named explicitly rather than left silent. (`quality/.scratch/` is working state — never let its contents leak into `quality/strategy.md`; the Effective Comms pass is a backstop for exactly that.)

If the review or the Effective Comms pass surfaces failures, return to the relevant sub-step(s) and re-do. The strategy is not done until both pass.

Once it passes, point the user at the three follow-on lanes so they know where to go next (see "The plan of work is a sketch" above) — each deliberately lighter than what they just finished: it ingests this strategy for the release, filters for the ilities its modality can dent, and works have / improve / add through them in a focused conversation or two. The lanes also read the ideas ledger (`quality/ideas.md`) — anything the user volunteered along the way meets its moment there, so mention it when it holds entries: *"the ideas you dropped as we went are queued up for the lanes too."* Recommend an **order** based on what the risk map just showed. The principle is **Q2 before Q3: you can only investigate what you can judge.**

- **Risk map dominated by Unknowns whose to-resolve notes say "nothing can judge this yet"** → recommend **`/evaluation-strategy`** first: decide how the project will judge those dimensions (with `/tooling-strategy` planning any agreed builds), then `/test-strategy` once (or as) the means of judging exist. Planning investigation against dimensions nothing can judge produces a plan that is mostly "blocked".
- **Risk map mostly judgeable** — the bases are real, the gaps are not-yet-investigated → recommend **`/test-strategy`** first: investigation moves the map immediately, and what it can't answer sharpens the evaluation lane's filter.
- **Risks concentrated in how work gets done** — consistency, hygiene, release safety, regression discipline → put **`/process-strategy`** early: a rule or process prevents the class while testing would only keep finding instances.

Name all three lanes, say which order you recommend and why, and don't leave the user at a finished strategy with no onward path — the risk map and plan of work they just produced are the lanes' direct inputs.

**And offer the payoff — `/quality-artefacts`.** The analytical continuations are not the only onward path: the moment the strategy is done is also the moment it can become something *shareable*. Offer it explicitly — *"want to see this as a dashboard, or a card you can screenshot and share? `/quality-artefacts` turns the strategy into a bespoke visual — a risk heatmap, a social card, a one-glance summary of where quality stands."* This is the delight payoff of the work just finished, not a footnote in the README; surface it alongside the three lanes, not buried beneath them. (It reads the finished, reviewed `quality/strategy.md`, so it belongs here at the end — but plant the idea earlier too; see sub-step 6.3's risk-map close.)

## When the user is genuinely stuck — offer a labelled strawman

Sometimes a user has no answer not because they're dodging the work but because they genuinely don't know yet — they can't name a stakeholder, can't put words to what "good" means, can't say what they'd de-prioritise. A blank page is paralysing; a wrong starting guess is not. People recognise what's wrong far more easily than they generate from nothing, so bouncing off a flawed suggestion often unlocks the real answer.

So when a user is genuinely **stuck** (not evasive — stuck), you may offer a **clearly-labelled strawman**: a concrete starting guess for them to react to, with a strong, explicit warning to scrutinise it rather than accept it.

- **Label it, loudly, every time.** *"Here's a starting guess — I'm partly inventing this to give you something to push against. Treat it as probably wrong and tear into it; don't just nod because it sounds plausible."* The user must always know it's a strawman and never mistake it for something the skill established.
- **Make it reactable.** A strawman only works if it's specific enough to disagree with: a named candidate stakeholder with a guessed bar, a concrete dimension with a guessed rating — not a vague menu of options.
- **Then interview as normal.** The strawman is a *prompt*, not an answer. What the user keeps, changes, or throws out becomes the real input, recorded as theirs. What they don't actively confirm does **not** silently survive into the strategy as fact — an un-reacted-to strawman is discarded, not banked.

**What this is — and isn't.** This is a facilitation aid for a stuck user, not a shortcut:

- **Never present fabricated content as established fact.** A strawman is labelled as a guess at the moment you offer it. An unlabelled invention asserted as a finding is exactly the failure this framework exists to prevent (PHILOSOPHY → *interview don't infer*, *record assumptions*). The line is bright: *"here's a guess, scrutinise it hard"* is good facilitation; *"your stakeholders value X"* (invented, unlabelled, presented as fact) is banned.
- **It does not soften the substantive refusals.** A strawman helps a user who's stuck; it does not let anyone skip the work the framework correctly insists on. Still refuse, as before: skipping non-goals, skipping the 5.2 unpack or the 5.3 old/new-world reasoning (the reasoning is mandatory even though it runs as machinery, not a user-facing walk), "just give me ratings", lowering rigour because the job feels small. Offering a strawman to an *unstuck* user who simply wants to move faster isn't facilitation — it's the corner-cutting the framework deliberately holds the line against. Use it for the blank page, not the impatient one.

## Escalation points — stop and ask the user

Pause the skill and surface a question (rather than push through) when:

- The user cannot identify any **real** stakeholder whose perspective counts — there is genuinely no one this is for. Strategy is impossible without that. But separate two cases that look alike: **(a)** a user who would have you *invent a stakeholder from nothing* — fabricate a persona and its bars → refuse; that's the fabrication the framework exists to prevent. **(b)** A **real solo owner answering for themselves** — they are the user, the buyer, and the operator → that is a valid stakeholder; proceed, interview them in that capacity, and record that they're answering for themselves. *"I'm the only one who matters right now"* is a real answer; *"let's make up who might matter"* is not. (A user who is real but simply stuck for words is different again — help them with a labelled strawman, see "When the user is genuinely stuck" above, rather than refusing or silently inferring.)
- The user gives contradictory answers across sub-steps. Surface the contradiction; do not paper over it.
- The budget or timeline does not match the ambition. Make the mismatch explicit; let the user decide.
- "Everything is critical" — the user resists naming non-goals. Push: *"What would you cut if you had half the time?"*
- You catch yourself filling in an answer the user has not given. Stop. Ask. Record the assumption explicitly if you must proceed.

## Output

All output lands under `$DOCS_DIR` — the save location chosen at session start (the chosen repo's root when the user chose in-repo, a folder outside the repos for a local first pass):

- `quality/strategy.md` — the strategy itself. Visible, top-level, meant to be read. Opens with the Operational TL;DR + triage rubric (from `/operational-distillation`) and the `## Strategy job` paragraph. Its header carries a **version stamp** (`Generated by the quality-strategy skill — … v<version>`) read from `$PLUGIN_ROOT/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at generation time, so a bug report filed against a generated strategy traces back to the exact skill version that produced it (see sub-step 1.1; refreshed on revision).
- `quality/pre-read.md` — the project digest produced by sub-step 0. Working artefact; informs but does not become part of the strategy.
- `quality/releases/<release-slug>.md` — the release bank: strategy content the user dictated for releases other than the one this strategy covers, captured faithfully per release (see "Scope of this skill"). Durable content, pre-loaded by new-release mode — not scratch.
- `quality/ideas.md` — the ideas ledger: measurement/rule/testing ideas the user volunteered spontaneously mid-strategy, in their words, linked to the dimension they arose in, unclassified at capture (see "Spontaneous user ideas"). Durable content, read by the follow-on lanes — not scratch.
- `quality/.scratch/<sub-step>-<purpose>.md` — sealed-dispatch scratch files (one per subagent dispatch; revision mode adds `revision-defect-recon.md`, `revision-context-scan.md`, and `revision-contradiction-check.md`), plus `session-config.md` (the session-start choices: repo scope with per-repo scratch slugs, save location, commit cadence). Working state, audited by `/quality-strategy-review`; not part of the strategy.
- `quality/archive/strategy-<date>.md` — pre-revision snapshots (see Revision mode). History, never overwritten.
